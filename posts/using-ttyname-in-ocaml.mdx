Introduction
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
In the last few weeks, I have been helping build an accessible diff viewer terminal application called <code>Diffcessible</code>. One of the features we wanted to implement was pager functionality, which involved using `ttyname` in OCaml. This post will walk through the implementation details, considerations, and edge cases encountered while integrating this functionality.

Using `ttyname` for Pager Functionality
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
To implement pager functionality, we needed to ensure that our application could handle input from both a file and standard input (stdin). When input is piped as a string, or when there is no input, our program should handle these cases gracefully to avoid unexpected behavior.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
The <code>ttyname</code> function retrieves the terminal name associated with a file descriptor, which is useful for ensuring proper terminal setup. We utilize this function to manage terminal I/O appropriately when <code>Diffcessible</code> is running in different modes.

<Pre>
open Diffcessible
open Cmdliner
open ExtUnix.Specific

let create_empty_diff_content () =
  "diff --git a/Error b/Error\n--- a/Error\n+++ b/Error\n"

let with_input_fd file_path f =
  if not (Sys.file_exists file_path) then
    failwith ("File not found: " ^ file_path);
  In_channel.with_open_bin file_path f

let with_setup_term f =
  let is_tty = Unix.isatty Unix.stdin in
  if is_tty then
    let term =
      Notty_unix.Term.create ~input:Unix.stdin ~output:Unix.stdout ()
    in
    Fun.protect
      (fun () -> f term)
      ~finally:(fun () -> Notty_unix.Term.release term)
  else
    let tty_path = ttyname Unix.stdout in
    let tty_fd = Unix.openfile tty_path [ Unix.O_RDWR ] 0o600 in
    let term = Notty_unix.Term.create ~input:tty_fd ~output:tty_fd () in
    Fun.protect
      (fun () -> f term)
      ~finally:(fun () ->
        Notty_unix.Term.release term;
        Unix.close tty_fd)

let read_input ic =
  try In_channel.input_all ic with _ -> create_empty_diff_content ()

let main file_path =
  with_setup_term (fun term ->
      let input_content =
        match file_path with
        | Some path -> with_input_fd path read_input
        | None ->
            if Unix.isatty Unix.stdin then create_empty_diff_content ()
            else read_input In_channel.stdin
      in
      let patch = Patch.to_diffs input_content in
      InteractiveViewer.start ~term patch)

...

let () = exit (Cmd.eval cmd)

Handling Edge Cases
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
Some of the key considerations and edge cases we handled include:
</Paragraph>

<Definition term="Piped Input">
When input is piped as a string, we need to read from stdin and ensure the content is processed correctly.
</Definition>

<Definition term="No Input">
When there is no input, we create an empty diff content to avoid the terminal going rogue or crashing.
</Definition>

<Paragraph>
By ensuring these cases are handled, we improve the robustness of our application and provide a smooth user experience regardless of how the input is provided.
</Paragraph>

<Highlight>
Ensuring that our application handles terminal setup correctly using <code>ttyname</code> and properly manages input cases helps us build a reliable and accessible diff viewer.
